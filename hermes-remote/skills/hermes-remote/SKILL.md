description: Manage a remote Hermes Agent deployment from the CLI — list/create/pause/trigger cron jobs, check status, inspect env vars, swap models, and send one-shot chat calls to the OpenAI-compatible /v1/chat/completions endpoint. Use this skill whenever you need to control a Hermes instance that lives on another machine (VPS, Coolify app, etc.), since the upstream `hermes` CLI only talks to a local gateway.
when_to_use: Trigger on phrases like "list the hermes crons", "pause the hermes cron", "check the hermes model", "what is hermes running", "swap the hermes model to X", "trigger the gbrain sync cron", "what's on the remote hermes", "show hermes env", "restart hermes", "ask hermes", "chat with hermes", "one-shot to hermes", anything about scheduled tasks or a direct chat call to a remote Hermes.

# hermes-remote

Remote CLI for talking to a [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) deployment over its REST API. Stdlib-only Python 3. No pip installs.

The binary lives at `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../bin/hermes-remote` inside this plugin, and `bin/` is auto-added to PATH when the plugin is enabled — so call it as `hermes-remote`.

## When to reach for this

- The user asks about the state of a remote Hermes instance (status, model, crons, env).
- The user wants to pause, resume, trigger, or delete a Hermes cron job.
- The user wants to create a new cron — **always use the skillify pattern below**, not a prompt-only job.
- The user wants to inspect which env vars Hermes can see vs has missing.

For one-shot chat calls (`/v1/chat/completions`), use `hermes-remote chat "<prompt>"` — needs `HERMES_CHAT_API_KEY` set (distinct from the admin password).

```bash
hermes-remote chat "status?"                               # quick one-shot
hermes-remote chat --model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 ...  # override per-call
hermes-remote chat --max-tokens 200 "..."                  # cap output
hermes-remote chat --system "Be terse." "what is k8s?"     # add system prompt
hermes-remote chat --json "..."                            # full response body
```

For multi-turn conversations or streaming, use an OpenAI-compatible SDK pointed at `$HERMES_URL/v1` — this wrapper is for one-shot calls and cron-friendly scripting.

## When NOT to use this — fall back to the Hermes REST API directly

**This wrapper covers a deliberately narrow slice:** status, model, env list (read-only), config get/set, cron CRUD, and one-shot chat. It does NOT wrap a local CLI — there is no `hermes` remote-control CLI to fall back to. "Fall back" here means **hit the Hermes REST API directly with `curl`** (or `http.client` / `requests`) using the same cookie + bearer token flow `hermes-remote` uses internally. There is no other route.

Specific cases where you should talk to the Hermes endpoint directly, not through `hermes-remote`:

- **Streaming chat responses.** `hermes-remote chat` buffers the full response then prints. For live token streaming, POST to `$HERMES_URL/v1/chat/completions` with `"stream": true` and an SSE-capable client.
- **Multi-turn conversations / conversation history.** The `chat` subcommand is one-shot (system + user only). Maintain a `messages[]` array yourself and POST to `/v1/chat/completions` directly, or use an OpenAI-compatible SDK pointed at `$HERMES_URL/v1`.
- **File uploads, attachments, or anything multipart.** Not wrapped. Hit the relevant Hermes endpoint with `curl -F` or a multipart-capable HTTP client.
- **Mutating env vars, editing existing cron jobs, managing deliveries/platforms/skills, or triggering a gateway restart.** `hermes-remote env list` is read-only; `cron create` exists but there is no `cron edit`; gateway/platform/skill/delivery management isn't wrapped at all. Use `curl` against `/api/env`, `/api/cron/jobs/<id>` (PUT/PATCH), `/api/gateway/*`, `/api/platforms/*`, `/api/skills/*` with the session cookie + bearer token.
- **Authentication/login flows or session management.** `hermes-remote` logs in silently on every call using `HERMES_PASSWORD`. If you need to inspect the raw `/login` response, manage cookies manually, or debug auth, hit `/login` directly.
- **Any Hermes endpoint the wrapper simply doesn't expose yet** — job run history, raw logs, delivery channels, webhooks. Grab the cookie + token the same way (`POST /login`, scrape `__HERMES_SESSION_TOKEN__` from `/`) and call the endpoint directly.

**Don't get stuck in a loop.** If the user needs something the wrapper clearly doesn't cover, switch to `curl` against the Hermes REST API immediately rather than contorting `hermes-remote` flags. The wrapper's job is to make the common read/cron paths ergonomic — not to be the only way in.


## Configure

Config is layered. Highest precedence first:

1. `--env-file <path>` passed on the CLI
2. `.env.local` / `.env` found by walking up from the current working directory
3. Shell environment (including vars exported via Claude Code settings)

**Project `.env` files override the shell** — opposite of the usual rule. This
lets you drop a `.env` in whichever repo you're working in and have it win
over any globals, without having to unset anything.

Only `HERMES_*` and `COOLIFY_*` keys are picked up from .env files.

If no URL or password is configured, the CLI prints a suggestion showing
exactly where to put them (project `.env` preferred, or `~/.claude/settings.json`
for a global default).

Set one URL mode and one password source.

**URL — one of:**

```bash
export HERMES_URL="https://hermes.example.com"
# OR for reverse-proxy-by-Host setups with flaky DNS:
export HERMES_VPS_IP="1.2.3.4"
export HERMES_HOST="hermes.example.com"
```

The second form hits the IP on port 80 directly and passes the Host header, letting Traefik/Caddy/Nginx route. Skips DNS.

**Password — one of:**

```bash
export HERMES_PASSWORD="..."                      # plain value
export HERMES_PASSWORD_CMD="pass show hermes"     # shell command, stdout is the password
```

If the Hermes instance is managed by Coolify, the script can fetch the password automatically:

```bash
export COOLIFY_URL="http://your-vps:8000"
export COOLIFY_API_KEY="..."
export HERMES_APP_UUID="..."
```

**Admin user** (optional, default `admin@example.com`):

```bash
export HERMES_ADMIN_USER="you@example.com"
```

## Commands

```bash
hermes-remote status                    # gateway state + connected platforms
hermes-remote model                     # current LLM + context window
hermes-remote env list [--all]          # env vars Hermes knows about
hermes-remote config get [key]          # read full config, or a dotted-path key
hermes-remote config set <key> <value>  # mutate config.yaml via /api/config
hermes-remote cron list                 # all cron jobs, one line each
hermes-remote cron show <id-or-name>    # full JSON for one job
hermes-remote cron pause <id>
hermes-remote cron resume <id>
hermes-remote cron trigger <id>         # fire on next scheduler tick
hermes-remote cron remove <id> -y
hermes-remote cron create \
    --name <name> --schedule "every 15m" \
    --script /path/to/work.sh \
    --prompt "If script output contains ERROR, report it. Otherwise [SILENT]." \
    --deliver origin --model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5
```

Most subcommands take `--json` for machine-parseable output. **Recommended: pipe through `jq`** for field extraction and filtering — e.g. `hermes-remote cron list --json | jq '.[] | select(.state=="paused") | .id'`, `hermes-remote config get --json | jq -r .model`, `hermes-remote status --json | jq .gateway_state`. Every JSON payload is prefixed with a `tool: {name, version}` field so you can self-diagnose version drift (`hermes-remote --version` also works).

## Changing the LLM model (READ THIS)

**Hermes's `config.yaml` overrides env vars for keys it knows about.** The `LLM_MODEL` env var only sets the default at first boot. Once config.yaml has a model, `LLM_MODEL` is ignored — so setting it in Coolify / Docker env and redeploying won't change anything.

To actually change the model, write it via the config API:

```bash
hermes-remote config set model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5
```

No redeploy needed — it's live. Verify:

```bash
hermes-remote model   # reads /api/model/info; should match immediately
```

Same applies to any other config.yaml key (agent.max_turns, compression.threshold, telegram.channel_prompts, etc.) — `config set` is the mutation path.

## Skillify cron pattern (READ BEFORE CREATING A CRON)

A Hermes cron job has two input fields: `prompt` and `script`.

- `prompt` runs **inside a full agent LLM session** on every tick. Default model, full context, tool loop. Expensive.
- `script` runs **before** the agent starts — pure shell/python, zero LLM tokens. Its stdout becomes context for the agent.

If your cron does deterministic work (sync, embed, poll, sanity check), the work belongs in `--script`. The agent should only be invoked to decide "report or stay quiet" based on the script's output.

**Template for any recurring deterministic cron:**

```bash
hermes-remote cron create \
    --name <job-name> \
    --schedule "every 15m" \
    --script /path/on/hermes/host/to/worker.sh \
    --prompt "If the script output contains ERROR, report the relevant lines. Otherwise respond with only [SILENT]." \
    --model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 \
    --deliver origin
```

When the agent's response starts with `[SILENT]`, Hermes suppresses delivery — so successful quiet runs cost essentially nothing.

**Why this matters (real incident):** A gbrain sync cron on our Hermes deployment was created with `--prompt` only, using the default Sonnet 4.6 model, running every 15 minutes. Each run invoked the full reasoning loop to execute two shell commands masquerading as reasoning work — burning OpenRouter credit fast. Fixing it to `--script` + minimal Haiku prompt was a roughly three-orders-of-magnitude cost reduction.

**Rules of thumb for cron models:**
- Cheap recurring jobs → `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` (fast, cheap, fine for "is this output an error?")
- Genuinely latent work (entity extraction, summarisation, non-trivial judgment) → stay on Sonnet but cap `max_tokens` in Hermes config.

## Quirks

- `is_build_time` is not a valid field on Hermes env POSTs (will 422). Stick to `{"key":..., "value":..., "is_preview": false, "is_literal": true}`.
- urllib.request overrides Host based on URL netloc; this script uses `http.client` with `skip_host=True` to honour explicit Host headers.
- Hermes's `/api/env` only lists vars that match its config schema. A var can be in the container's shell env but not in this list — they're different surfaces.

## Troubleshooting

- **`HTTP 401` from /login**: password wrong, or you're hitting the `:3000` port directly and it has a separate basic-auth gate in front. Route through the main reverse-proxy URL.
- **`Couldn't extract __HERMES_SESSION_TOKEN__`**: login worked but the SPA HTML didn't include the token. Probably a version mismatch; upstream Hermes < 0.10 may not expose it in the same place.
- **`Unauthorized` on specific `/api/*` endpoints with cookie + token set**: that endpoint isn't wired up in your Hermes version, or you're on a preview that renamed it. Try listing with `--json` on a known-good endpoint first to confirm auth is working.
