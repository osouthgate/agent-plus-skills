# railway-ops

Read-first wrapper around the [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.app/reference/cli-api) for fast environment inspection during incident triage. Stdlib-only Python 3, no dependencies.

Part of [agent-plus](../README.md) — Claude Code plugins that cut the tool-call and token cost of driving APIs from an agent.

## Why

Not a replacement for the Railway dashboard or CLI. This exists so an AI agent (or a human in a hurry) gets **one-call situational awareness** across a project's services instead of stitching together five separate `railway` invocations.

**Measured wins**

- `overview` fans out to every service in parallel (~8 worker threads): logs + deploy status + env var names per service, all in one call. A 5-service project resolves in **~8s** instead of **~40s** sequential.
- **activeDeploy vs latestDeploy.** The Railway CLI only exposes one deploy per service; when a newer build failed on top of a serving SUCCESS, the CLI would collapse that into "everything's broken." With `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` set, the tool queries Railway's GraphQL API to split the two out with timestamps, commit SHA, PR number, and branch on each. Triage signal: `activeDeploy=SUCCESS` + `latestDeploy=FAILED` = traffic fine, someone just tried to ship.
- **Build logs attached to failed deploys.** When `latestDeploy` is FAILED and distinct from `activeDeploy`, `overview` auto-attaches `buildLogTail` (last ~30 build-log lines), `buildErrorKinds` (fingerprint→count), and `buildLineCount` to that deploy. One call tells the whole story — no second request needed to see why the build broke.
- **Postgres-aware log classification.** Messages matching `<ts> UTC [<pid>] <LEVEL>:` are classified by the embedded pg level, so routine `LOG: checkpoint complete` lines don't flood the error bucket even though Railway stamps them as stderr.
- Log lines are classified server-side — `error` / `warning` / other — deduped and capped per service (default 20, configurable via `--limit`). Pre-cap `errorTotal` and fingerprint-bucketed `errorKinds` make truncation self-documenting: a flood of 800 identical FK violations shows up as one bucket with count=800, not 20 silent lines.
- **Env var values never touch output.** `railway variables` exposes values; this CLI parses them in `strip_env_values`, keeps names, drops the dict. A canary-value no-leak test asserts no value substring can appear in any output path.
- **Read-only by design.** `railway up`, `railway redeploy`, and variable writes are not wrapped. If you need to write, use `railway` directly.
- **Self-diagnosing output.** Every JSON response carries a top-level `tool: {name, version}` field read from the plugin manifest. Agents can see their binary version from the output alone — no extra subprocess call to detect version drift.
- **JSON-first contract.** Every command emits a single JSON document on stdout. Field names are stable across releases (additive changes only). Human-readable output is opt-in via `--pretty`; the default is compact JSON for piping into `jq`, scripts, or agent tooling.

## Install

### Recommended — marketplace install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add osouthgate/agent-plus-skills
claude plugin install railway-ops@agent-plus-skills
```

Adds `railway-ops` to PATH and loads the skill so Claude reaches for it automatically.

### Session-only (dev / try-before-install)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/osouthgate/agent-plus-skills
claude --plugin-dir ./agent-plus/railway-ops
```

`--plugin-dir` loads for the current shell only; nothing persisted.

### Standalone — no Claude Code

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osouthgate/agent-plus-skills/main/railway-ops/bin/railway-ops
chmod +x railway-ops
./railway-ops overview
```

## Prerequisites

- `railway` CLI on PATH — install: https://docs.railway.app/reference/cli-api#installation
- Authed: `railway login`
- Linked to a project in whichever directory you run from: `railway link`
- **Optional**: `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` (or `RAILWAY_TOKEN`) env var. Unlocks deploy history via Railway's GraphQL API — needed for `activeDeploy` / `latestDeploy` split, build-log tails on failed deploys, `errors --since-deploy`, and the `build-logs` subcommand's auto-resolve path. Without it the tool still works on a single-deploy fallback from the CLI.

The CLI checks preconditions at startup and exits with a clear message if any are missing.

## Commands

All commands emit JSON on stdout. `--pretty` switches to indented JSON for humans; omit it for compact output suitable for `jq` / pipelines. `--env` accepts short forms (`prod` → `production`, `stag` → `staging`); an ambiguous substring raises a clear error rather than silently picking one.

`--output <path>` (available on every subcommand) writes the full JSON payload to disk and prints only a compact envelope on stdout — `payloadPath`, `bytes`, `payloadKeys`, `payloadShape` (type + size per key, recursive), and (for log-shaped payloads) head+tail line previews. Use it when the response is large enough that routing it through an agent's context window is wasteful (`build-logs` with high `--lines`, `overview` for many services). The envelope is the agent's cue to decide whether to `Read` the file at all, and `payloadShape` points at which top-level key (and nested slice) to drill into. `--shape-depth <1|2|3>` controls recursion depth (default `3`).

```bash
# One-call snapshot — project, env, services, active+latest deploys with commit meta,
# recent errors/warnings with fingerprint buckets, env var NAMES. When latestDeploy
# is FAILED and distinct from activeDeploy, it's auto-enriched with buildLogTail
# and buildErrorKinds so you see WHY the build failed in the same response.

# Current linked context (project/env/service + whoami)

| `buildLineCount`  | int             | Total lines pulled from the build stream         |

Contract rules:

- Fields listed above are guaranteed to be present (non-breaking additions allowed in future releases).
- `summary` always returns all four counters, even when every value is `0`.
- Env var *values* are never emitted — only `envVarNames`. Enforced by canary-value no-leak tests.
- `--pretty` only affects whitespace; field names and nesting are identical to the compact output.

## Architecture

- Shells out to `railway` via `subprocess.run` with a 30s timeout per call.
- Services queried in parallel via `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` (8 workers).
- Env var parsing isolated in `strip_env_values`, covered by canary-value no-leak tests.
- Log classification is regex-based with a Postgres-aware override: pg-shape lines use the embedded `LOG/WARNING/ERROR:` level; other lines fall back to `/\b(error|fatal|panic|exception|traceback|unhandled)\b/i` → errors, `/\b(warn|warning)\b/i` → warnings.
- Deploy history uses Railway's GraphQL API at `backboard.railway.com/graphql/v2` when `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` (or `RAILWAY_TOKEN`) is set. Any failure (missing token, network, schema drift) silently falls back to the single-deploy shape from `railway service status`.
- Build logs for failed deploys come from `railway logs --deployment <id>`. A build-specific regex (`failed|cache key|not found|exit code|…`) catches the Docker/BuildKit failure modes that runtime's ERROR_RE misses.

## Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s test -p "test_*.py"
```

~80 tests covering:

- `strip_env_values` (including canary-value no-leak invariants across object, list, and `KEY=VALUE` shapes).
- Runtime log classification, bucket dedupe + cap, pg embedded-level detection (ERROR/FATAL/PANIC vs LOG/STATEMENT/DETAIL), and plain-text vs JSON log handling.
- Fingerprint-based error bucketing (`errorKinds`): UUID/number/quoted-string normalisation, top-N ordering, flood-resistance against 800 identical FK violations.
- Build-log enrichment: `_bucket_build_log` and `enrich_deploy_with_build_logs` only fire on failed deploys with distinct IDs; tail + errorKinds shape tests.
- Deploy splitting: `classify_deploys` active vs latest selection, `_slim_deploy` commit metadata extraction, environment ID / name resolution (prefix + substring + ambiguity).
- End-to-end snapshot shape with a stubbed `railway` subprocess runner.
- **Schema contract tests** for `overview` JSON output: top-level keys, `summary` rollup math, `filter` narrowing (case-insensitive, empty-match), `bucket_cap` plumb-through, per-service key stability, and JSON round-trip safety.
- Tool metadata: `_with_tool_meta` dict-vs-passthrough behavior, version from plugin manifest, ordering (tool field first).
- Argparse contract: `overview` flags, env-short-form resolution, `--since-deploy` plumbing.
